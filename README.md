# README

The ruby version required for rails `6.1.x` is `>= 2.5.0`

From the root of your app, run `bundle` to install required gems and dependent gems.

To start your web server, from the root of your app run: `rails s`

To start webpacker (so that your css and javascript is served), from the root of your app run: `./bin/webpack-dev-server` 

**Background:** In your environment, you likely need to start both the web server and webpacker so that both your web app and your web app's assets are served.
